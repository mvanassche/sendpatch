* Tasks

** TODO [#A] Add a command-line option to recover last log message

In case the commit failed, to avoid having to retype it all or find and insert
the right message.

** TODO [#A] Check that the configuration files are in Unix format

Check it, or convert them if needed.

This is a common source of problems...

** TODO Move to first editing line with if =EDITOR= is =emacsclient=

Run =forward-paragraph= to skip the comments in the header of the patch file.

SolutionÂ : if =EDITOR= = emacsclient, set =EDITOR_OPTIONS= to
"-e (forward-paragraph)".

** TODO Add ability to add private notes which won't be committed

** TODO Add the ability to make a review

That is, the title should be "review" instead of "patch" (or "diff"), and no
commit should be done.

** TODO Check that related programs are accessible

=makelog=, =makediff=, ... are needed, so we better check that they're in the
=PATH=.

** TODO For Unix systems, use the default =mail= command

** TODO [#C] Add support of Git

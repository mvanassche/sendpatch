* Tasks

** TODO Check errors from svn diff

If =svn diff= stops with an error, print it out (by re-running =svn diff=, sending
stdout to =/dev/null=?), and do try to make up the commit message.

Steps to reproduce: delete a file which was in SVN, such as a useless =.tex= file.

** TODO [#A] Add a command-line option to recover last log message

In case the commit failed, to avoid having to retype it all or find and insert
the right message.

** DONE [#A] Check answers to questions
   :LOGBOOK:
   - State "TODO"        ->  "DONE"       [2012-10-29 Mon 16:55]
   :END:

The only permitted answers (to binary questions) are "y" or "n". All other
letters should be discarded, and the question should be asked again.

** TODO [#A] Check that the configuration files are in Unix format

Check it, or convert them if needed.

This is a common source of problems...

** DONE Stop with an error if the email command is not defined
   :LOGBOOK:
   - State "TODO"        ->  "DONE"       [2013-02-04 Mon 17:10]
   :END:

To avoid mails sent under the name of John Doe.

** TODO Add ability to add private notes which won't be committed

** DONE Check what's going on when committing on TFS
   :LOGBOOK:
   - State "TODO"        ->  "DONE"       [2012-07-02 Mon 14:10]
   :END:

When there are multiple workspaces on your machine, are we sure that TF only
checks in files which are in the current subtree?

Yes, that does work (FPZ has 3 workspaces on his machine, and when committing
from a subtree, only files from that subtree are committed).

** TODO Add the ability to make a review

That is, the title should be "review" instead of "patch" (or "diff"), and no
commit should be done.

** TODO Check that related programs are accessible

=makelog=, =makediff=, ... are needed, so we better check that they're in the
PATH.

** TODO For Unix systems, use the default =mail= command
